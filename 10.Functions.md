## 1. Introduction to Functions

### 1.1 What is a function?

A function in programming is a <span style="color: orange">self-contained, reusable block of code</span> which acts as a
mini-program within a larger program.

Functions allow you to segment your code into
***modular***, ***manageable*** pieces, thereby enhancing ***readability***, simplifying
***debugging*** and improving ***coding experience*** overall.

### 1.2 Real world examples

Let's say we have a complex repetitive task, baking cakes. And let's say that in order to
bake a singular cake we have to run this code:

```python
print("1. Preheat the oven to 350°")
print("2. Mix flour, sugar, and eggs.")
print("3. Bake for 30 minutes.")
print("4. Let the cake cool and serve.")
```

So if we had to bake 4 cakes in different times, and we had to do it _without_ using
functions, our code would look like this:

```python
print("1. Preheat the oven to 350°")
print("2. Mix flour, sugar, and eggs.")
print("3. Bake for 30 minutes.")
print("4. Let the cake cool and serve.")

print("1. Preheat the oven to 350°")
print("2. Mix flour, sugar, and eggs.")
print("3. Bake for 30 minutes.")
print("4. Let the cake cool and serve.")

print("1. Preheat the oven to 350°")
print("2. Mix flour, sugar, and eggs.")
print("3. Bake for 30 minutes.")
print("4. Let the cake cool and serve.")

print("1. Preheat the oven to 350°")
print("2. Mix flour, sugar, and eggs.")
print("3. Bake for 30 minutes.")
print("4. Let the cake cool and serve.")
```

Let's write the same code, but **with functions** this time.

### 1.3 Syntax

In Python functions are defined by `def` keyword <span style="color: orange">_followed by the name_</span> of the function
, then curly brackets `()` and semicolon `:`.

***NOTE***: Take a look at **_indentation_**, in case it's wrong the `Python` interpreter will not be able to compile the
code.

#### Example

```python
def print_cake_recipe():
    print("1. Preheat the oven to 350°")
    print("2. Mix flour, sugar, and eggs.")
    print("3. Bake for 30 minutes.")
    print("4. Let the cake cool and serve.")
    print("\n")


print_cake_recipe() # we call the function in order to execute code inside it
print_cake_recipe()
print_cake_recipe()
print_cake_recipe()
```

#### Explanation

We created a function `print_cake_recipe()` and then called it 4 times, let's see what
happens when we run it.

#### Output

```
1. Preheat the oven to 350°
2. Mix flour, sugar, and eggs.
3. Bake for 30 minutes.
4. Let the cake cool and serve.

1. Preheat the oven to 350°
2. Mix flour, sugar, and eggs.
3. Bake for 30 minutes.
4. Let the cake cool and serve.

1. Preheat the oven to 350°
2. Mix flour, sugar, and eggs.
3. Bake for 30 minutes.
4. Let the cake cool and serve.

1. Preheat the oven to 350°
2. Mix flour, sugar, and eggs.
3. Bake for 30 minutes.
4. Let the cake cool and serve.
```

Now you can see that it is a **_very convenient_** way to write the programs, <span style="color: orange">as you can
collect chunks of your code into functions</span> and <span style="color: green">call them every time you need</span>.

***NOTE***: If we try to assign function value to a variable, it will be `None`, more on this in "10.5 Return".

## 2. Parameters and Arguments

Often you need to work with dynamic values within your function and the optimal
approach to this challenge would be implementing _parameters_.

### 2.1 Syntax

**Objective**: Write an `addition` function that would take two values and print the sum of these two values.
Here is an example of how this code would look like:

#### Example

```python
def addition(a, b):
    print(a + b)

addition(1, 3)
```

#### Output

```
4
```

#### Explanation

We defined function `addition` and inside parentheses we declared the parameters: `a` and `b`. 

Then we called the function and passed arguments `1` and `3`, as `a` and `b` accordingly.

### 2.2  Parameters vs Arguments

As irrelevant as it might seem, there is a difference between these two key terms.  The function <span style="color:orange">***parameters*** are the names listed in the function's definition</span> and the function <span style="color:green">***arguments*** are the real values passed to the function</span>.

You just need to understand that once you pass value `11` to the parameter `a` into the function, it becomes an argument.

## 3. Positional vs Key Arguments

When calling functions in Python, the arguments you pass can be either ***positional*** or ***keyword*** arguments. <span style="color:red">Understanding the difference and the proper usage of each type is crucial for writing clear and error-free code</span>.

### 3.1 Positional Arguments

Positional arguments are arguments that need to be included in the correct order. The order in which you pass the values when calling the function should match the order in which the parameters were defined in the function.

#### Example

```python
def create_profile(name, age, profession):
    print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Profession: {profession}")

create_profile("Alice", 30, "Engineer")
```

#### Output

```
Name: Alice, Age: 30, Profession: Engineer
```

#### Explanation

In this example, `"Alice"` is passed as the `name`, `30` as the `age`, and `"Engineer"` as the `profession`, <span style="color:orange">following the ***order*** they were ***defined*** in the function</span>.

We did it sequentially, so that params are in the same order. Never mix the order of your arguments, it can blow out your code! 

### 3.2 Keyword Arguments

***Keyword arguments***, on the other hand, <span style="color:orange">are arguments passed to a function, accompanied by an identifier</span>.

You explicitly state which parameter you're passing the argument to by using the name of the parameter. <span style="color:green">This means the order of the arguments ***does not matter***, as long as all required parameters are provided</span>.

#### Example

```python
def create_profile(name, age, profession):
    print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Profession: {profession}")

create_profile(age=30, profession="Engineer", name="Alice")
```

#### Output

```
Name: Alice, Age: 30, Profession: Engineer
```

#### Explanation

Here, even though the order of arguments is ***different*** from the order of
parameters in the function definition, Python knows which argument corresponds
to which parameter, thanks to the keyword parameters.

Personally I prefer the following (????) approach, following it, your codebase becomes much cleaner.

## 4. Scopes

The scope of a variable refers to <span style="color:orange">the context in which it is ***visible*** or ***accessible*** in the code.</span> In Python, scopes help manage and isolate variables in different parts of the program, ensuring that variable names don't clash and create unexpected behaviors. <span style="color:green">

The two main types of scopes are ***local*** and ***global***</span>.

### 4.1 Local scope

Variables declared **within** a function have **local** scope, they are created when function is called and destroyed when it finishes its execution. <span style="color:red">Local variables declared in a functions can only be accessed from within this function</span>.


#### Example

```python
def addition():
    suma = 10 + 15
    print(suma)

addition()
```

#### Output

```
25
```


#### Example

```python
def addition():
    summ = 10 + 15
    print(summ)

print(summ)
```

#### Output

```
NameError: name 'summ' is not defined.
```

#### Explanation

In this case we declare variable `suma` and since we created it **inside** the function
it has **local** scope, therefore we wouldn't be able to call it from outside.


### 4.2 Global scope

Variables declared ***outside*** all the functions have a global scope. They can be
**accessed** from any part of the code, ***including*** inside functions,
<span style="color:red">unless overshadowed by a local variable with the same name</span>.

#### Example

```python
total = 50

def print_added_total():
    print(total + 50)

print_added_total()
```

#### Output

```
100
```

#### Explanation
Here, we declared variable **outside** the function, therefore it has global scope and can be *accessed* and *modified* from *wherever* one might need.

However, if we attempt to ***reassign*** a different value to the global variable from within the function the program will not work as intended.

#### Example

```python
total = 50

def update_total():
    total += 50

update_total()
```

#### Output

```
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'total' referenced before assignment
```

This happens because you <span style = "color:red">can't reassign</span> value to a variable, unless you use keyword `global`, however
it is strongly advised not to use it, as this will introduce redundant complexity to your code, making it less clear and 
more bug prone.

Here it is important to understand the difference between reassigning a value and modifying an object as if we attempt 
to append an element to a list declared with global scope it won't cause any problems.

#### Example

```python
list1 = ["a", "b"]

def update_list():
    list1.append("c")

    
update_list()
print(list1)
```

#### Output

```
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

### 4.3 Best practices

1. **Use Few Global Variables**: Try to use global variables (those outside functions) *<u>as little as possible</u>* to avoid confusion.

2. **Keep Variables Local**: Use variables inside functions for things that only matter in that function. This helps keep your code *<u>clean and easy to understand</u>*.

3. **Be Careful with Same Names**: If you use the *<u>same</u>* name for a variable *<u>inside</u>* and *<u>outside</u>* a function, the function <span style="color:red">will only know about the inside one</span>.

## 5. Return

The `return` statement in a function <span style="color:orange">sends a value from within the function's local scope to where the function has been called</span>. It's a powerful way to pass data *out of a function* and can be used to send **any type** of object back to the caller.

### 5.1 Syntax

The `return` statement is followed by the **value** or **expression** you want to return. <span style="color:red">If no value or expression is specified, the function will return `None`</span>.

#### Example

```python
def addition(a, b):
    return a + b

sum_of_two_numbers = addition(1, 3)
print(sum_of_two_numbers)
```

#### Output

```
4
```

In this example, the `addition` function takes two positional arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum returning the value to `sum_of_two_numbers` variable.

***Note***: Any operation after the `return` statement will not be executed.

#### Example

```python
def addition(a, b):
    return a + b
    print("this message will never be output")


sum_of_two_numbers = addition(1, 3)
print(sum_of_two_numbers)
```

#### Output

```
4
```

## 6. Optional Parameters

In Python functions <span style="color:orange">can be called with a ***varying*** number of parameters</span>. This feature enhances ***flexibility*** and ***usability*** of the code depending on the scenario. 
Optional parameters have **default values**, which are used if ***no argument*** is passed during the function call.

### 6.1 Benefits of Optional Parameters

Optional parameters make your functions more **flexible**. <span style="color:orange">They allow you to create more generalized functions that can handle a wider range of inputs</span>. 

Thanks to optional parameters you will be able <span style="color:green">to use the same function for slightly different purposes</span> **without** overloading it with arguments or creating multiple, nearly identical functions.


### 6.2 Syntax

To define an optional parameter, you ***assign it a default value*** in the function's definition using operator `=`. <span Introductionstyle="color:red">This default value is used if the caller does not provide a value for that parameter</span>.

#### Example

```python
def greet(name, message="Hello"):
    print(f"{message}, {name}!")


greet("Alice")
greet("Bob", "Good morning")
```

#### Output

```
Hello, Alice!
Good morning, Bob!
```

#### Explanation

In the `greet` function above, `name` is a **mandatory** parameter, while `message` is **optional** with a *<u>default value</u>* of `"Hello"`. If no `message` is provided when the function is called, it uses the *<u>default value</u>*.


***Important***: You can only assign default values to parameters ***after*** you have declared your positional arguments, more on this in ***args/kwargs*** section

## 7. `Args` and `Kwargs`


In Python, `*args` and `**kwargs` are **special operators** used in function definitions. <span style="color:orange">They allow a function to accept a variable number of arguments</span>, making your functions more flexible. `*args` is used for **positional** arguments, while `**kwargs` is used for **keyword** arguments.

### 7.1 `*args`

The `*args` parameter <span style="color:orange">allows a function to take ***any number*** of ***positional*** arguments without having to define each one individually</span>.

***Note*** The arguments passed to `*args` are accessible as a **tuple**. Therefore, contents of `args` ***can not*** and ***should not*** be altered in traditional ways.

#### Example

```python
def calculate_sum(*numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total


print(calculate_sum(10, 20, 30))  # Output: 60
```

#### Explanation

In this example, `calculate_sum()` can take **any number** of numerical arguments,
sum them up, and return the total. The `*numbers` parameter collects all the
positional arguments into a tuple called `numbers`.

### 7.1.1 Unpacking parameters

As we learned previously in data types, you can use `*` to unpack the elements of an iterable. Be aware that if you 
pass an iterable to a function without unpacking it, you will pass the iterable as a whole unpacked object (rather than passing the individual elements in the iterable).

***NOTE***: Same applies for `**kwargs`

#### Example

```python
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]


def example(*args):
    for argument in args:
        print(argument)

        
example(list1)
```

#### Output

```
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

Therefore, if you want to pass all the elements of `list1` we will need to unpack them first.

#### Example

```python
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]


def example(*args):
    for argument in args:
        print(argument)

        
example(*list1)
```

#### Output

```
a
b
c
```

### 7.2 `**kwargs`

The `**kwargs` parameter <span style="color:orange">allows a function to accept any number of keyword arguments</span>. This is useful when you want to handle named arguments in your function. The keyword arguments passed to `**kwargs` are stored in a **dictionary**.

#### Example

```python
def student_info(**details):
    for key, value in details.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")


student_info(name="John", grade="A", subject="Mathematics")
```

#### Output:

```
name: John
grade: A
subject: Mathematics
```

#### Explanation
In this example, `student_info()` can accept **any number** of keyword arguments. The `**details` parameter collects all the keyword arguments into a dictionary called `details`.

## 8. Argument Ordering

When defining a function, <span style="color:red">it's important to follow the correct order of parameters to avoid syntax errors</span>. The order should be:

1. Standard arguments
2. `*args`
3. `**kwargs`

This order ensures that your function can handle a <span style="color:orange">mix of standard, positional, and keyword arguments</span> effectively.

#### Example of Correct Syntax

```python
def mix_and_match(a, b, *args, **kwargs):
    pass  # Function implementation
```

#### Example 

Incorrect Syntax - Will Cause an Error!

```python
def mix_and_match(a, b, **kwargs, *args):
    pass
```

#### Output:

```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

## 10. Homework

### Task 1: Star Rectangle

**Objective**: Implement a function named `draw_rectangle` that outputs a rectangle made of asterisks (`*`). The rectangle should have a width of 7 characters and a height of 6 lines.

#### Requirements:

- Use nested `for` loops to generate the rectangle.
- The outer loop should iterate through the lines (height), and the inner loop should iterate through the characters (width) on each line.
- Only the border of the rectangle should be drawn with asterisks, while spaces (` `) should fill the interior.
- The function does not need to return anything; it should directly print the rectangle to the console.


```
*******
*     *
*     *
*     *
*     *
*******
```

### Task 2: Sum of Digits

**Objective**: Create a function `print_digit_sum` that calculates and prints the sum of all digits in a given integer.

#### Requirements:

- The function should accept a single integer argument, possibly negative.
- Convert the integer to its absolute value to handle negative numbers.
- Iterate over each digit in the number and calculate the total sum.
- Print the result to the console. The function returns `None`.


```python
print_digit_sum(1234)  # Output: 10
print_digit_sum(-567)  # Output: 18
```

### Task 3: Find All Factors

**Objective**: Develop a function `get_factors` that returns a list of all the divisors of a given natural number.

#### Requirements:

- The function should accept a single integer argument, `num`.
- If `num` is less than 1, return an empty list to reflect the definition of natural numbers.
- Efficiently find and return a list of all divisors of `num`.
- Ensure correct functionality for both small and large values of `num`.


```python
print(get_factors(28))  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28]
print(get_factors(13))  # Output: [1, 13]
print(get_factors(0))   # Output: []
```

### Task 4: Temperature Converter

**Objective**: Enhance the `convert_temperature` function to support optional parameters for conversion direction.

#### Requirements:

- The function should accept one mandatory parameter for the temperature value and one optional parameter for the direction of conversion (`'C'` for Celsius to Fahrenheit, `'F'` for Fahrenheit to Celsius).
- Use default arguments to assume conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit if the direction is not specified.
- Calculate and return the converted temperature value.


```python
print(convert_temperature(100))  # Assumes Celsius to Fahrenheit, Output: 212
print(convert_temperature(212, convert_to='C'))  # Fahrenheit to Celsius, Output: 100
```

### Task 5: Statistics Calculator

**Objective**: Implement a function `calculate_statistics` that computes various statistical measures (mean, median, mode, range) for a dataset, based on specified options.

#### Requirements:

- The function should accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments (`*data`) representing the dataset.
- Accept keyword arguments (`**options`) to specify which statistics to calculate: `mean`, `median`, `mode`, `range`. If an option is `True`, calculate that statistic.
- Return a dictionary with keys as the names of the statistics calculated and their corresponding results as values.
- If no options are specified, calculate and return all statistics.
- Handle edge cases such as empty datasets or datasets without a mode.


```python
data_points = [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5]
print(calculate_statistics(*data_points, mean=True, range=True))
# Output: {'mean': 2.8333333333333335, 'range': 4}

print(calculate_statistics(*data_points))
# Output: {'mean': ..., 'median': ..., 'mode': ..., 'range': ...}
```
