## 1. Overview of Tuples

In `Python` a `tuple` is an  _immutable, ordered sequence of items_.

Similar to `lists`, `tuples` can contain elements of different data types, but <span style="color:red"> _**cannot**_ be modified after their creation</span>.


Why do we need them, if we have `lists`?

| Advantage                    | Description                                                                                         |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Efficiency**        | Have a fixed size, which makes them more memory-efficient than `lists`.      |
| **Faster than Lists**        | Due to their immutability, tuples can be slightly faster than `lists` when iterating through large datasets. |
| **Fixed Data**               | Ideal for storing data that shouldn't change over time, such as configuration values or constants.  |
| **Easier Debugging**         | With immutability, it's much easier to track changes and debug your code, as tuples don't change state unexpectedly. |

There are more advantages which we will see during expanding of our knowledge into the next lessons:

| Advantage                    | Description                                                                                         |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Suitable as Dictionary Keys** | Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries due to their immutability.                               |
| **Functionality in Functions** | Useful for passing multiple values to and from functions, ensuring they remain unaltered.          |
| **Hashable**                 | Tuples are hashable, which means they can be used as keys in sets or as unique identifiers.        |

### 1.1 Syntax and Creation

In order to create an empty `tuple` we can use the following syntax:

#### Example
```python
tuple_1 = ()
tuple_2 = tuple()

print(tuple_1, tuple_2)
print(type(tuple_1), type(tuple_2))
```

#### Output
```
() ()
<class 'tuple'> <class 'tuple'>
```

### 1.2 Convert iterables into `tuple`

As with `lists` you can convert other `iterable data types` to a `tuple` using the `tuple()` constructor.

This feature is particularly useful when you need the immutability of `tuples`, or when a specific `API` requires a `tuple` instead of another `iterable`, or you want to have a representation of some data in this format.

### Example
```python
# Converting a list to a tuple
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print(my_tuple)

# Converting a string to a tuple
my_string = "hello"
string_tuple = tuple(my_string)
print(string_tuple)
```
#### Output
```
(1, 2, 3)
('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')
```

You can create a `tuple` just asigning a few variables into with coma and parentheses. 

#### Example

```python
another_tuple = 2, 'world', 1.618
print("Another tuple:", another_tuple)
print("Type:", type(another_tuple))
```

#### Output
```
Another tuple: (2, 'world', 1.618)
Type: <class 'tuple'>
```

### 1.3 Immutability

Once a `tuple` is created, its elements <span style="color:red"> _**cannot**_ be changed, removed, or added</span>. This immutability makes tuples a reliable data structure for storing <span style="color:orange">_unchangeable_</span> data.


***IMPORTANT***: Though, you have to understand that if the `tuple` has mutable objects inside, you can access and modify them there.

#### Example

```python
tuple_1 = ([1,2,3], [5,6])
print("Tuple before:", tuple_1)
print("ID before:", id(tuple_1))

# Modifying a mutable object inside the tuple
tuple_1[-1].append(4)

print("Tuple after:", tuple_1)
print("ID after:", id(tuple_1))
```

#### Output
```
Tuple before: ([1, 2, 3], [5, 6])
ID before: 139653455025920
Tuple after: ([1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 4])
ID after: 139653455025920
```

Yes, it's `Python` baby, but I promise, you will get used to this once understand the concept of objects and how do they work.

Note that `id` of the `tuple` hasn't changed, but the content of the objects inside has.

## 2. Features Overview

Same as lists, `Python` tuples support `indexing`, `slicing`, `concatenation`, `multiplication`, `unpacking` and some `built-in` functions.

Suppose we have the following two tuples:

```python
first_tuple = (1, 'hello', 3.14)
second_tuple = 2, 'world', 1.618
```

### 2.1 Indexing and Slicing in Tuples

#### Example

```python
# Indexing
print(first_tuple[1])

# Slicing
print(second_tuple[1:])
```

#### Output

```
hello
('world', 1.618)
```

### 2.2 Concatenation and Multiplication

#### Example

```python
# Concatenation
combined_tuple = first_tuple + second_tuple

# Multiplication
repeated_tuple = first_tuple * 2

print("Combined:", combined_tuple)
print("Repeated:", repeated_tuple)
```

#### Output
```
Combined: (1, 'hello', 3.14, 2, 'world', 1.618)
Repeated: (1, 'hello', 3.14, 1, 'hello', 3.14)
```

### 2.3 Unpacking

#### Example

```python
x, y, z = first_tuple
print(f"x={x},y={y},z={z}")
```

#### Output
```
x=1,y=hello,z=3.14
```

### 2.4 Operator `in`

#### Example
```python
if 'hello' in first_tuple:
    print("Found 'hello' in the tuple!")   
```

#### Output
```
Found 'hello' in the tuple!
```

### 2.5 Functions

#### Example

```python
constants = (3.14, 2.7, 36.6)

length = len(constants)
max_value = max(constants)
min_value = min(constants)
sum_value = sum(constants)
sorted_list = sorted(constants)

print("Lenght:", length)
print("Max:", max_value)
print("Min:", min_value)
print("Sum:", sum_value)
print("Sorted:", sorted_list)      # Note that ``sorted()`` returns a ``list`` instead!
```

#### Output
```
Lenght: 3
Max: 36.6
Min: 2.7
Sum: 42.44
Sorted: [2.7, 3.14, 36.6]
```

Basically, it's very similar to `lists`, but don't forget that `Python` doesn't allow modification of immutable objects.

### 2.6 Tuple Methods

There are only two methods for `tuples`.

```
nums = (1, 2, 3)
```
| Method          | Description                                        | Example                         | Output                        |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------- |---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `index(x)`     | Returns the index of the first item whose value is x.|   `nums.index(3)`                 | `2`                          |
| `count(iterable)` | Returns the number of times x appears in the tuple. | `nums.count(1)`                 | `1`                          |

## 3. Iterations

Typically we use tuples for storing _constants_.

### 3.1 Using `for in`

#### Example

```python
# Rainbow is a constant so that ``tuple`` is a great choice to store its colors
rainbow = ('red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet')
for color in rainbow:
    print(color)
```

#### Output
```
red
orange
yellow
green
blue
indigo
violet
```

### 3.2 `for index in range(len(tuple))`

```python
# Tuple of prime numbers
primes = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11)
for index in range(len(primes)):
    print(f"Prime number at index {index} is {primes[index]}")
```

#### Output

```
Prime number at index 0 is 2
Prime number at index 1 is 3
Prime number at index 2 is 5
Prime number at index 3 is 7
Prime number at index 4 is 11
```

### 3.3 Using `enumerate()`

There is a built-in function called `enumerate()`, that adds a counter to an iterable.

It can be used with <span style="color:green"> any iterable</span> and be particulary useful when <span style="color:green"> both the element and its index </span> are needed.

```python
# Tuple of weekdays
weekdays = ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday')
for index, day in enumerate(weekdays):
    print(f"{day} is the {index+1}-th day of the workweek.")
```

```
Monday is the 1-th day of the workweek.
Tuesday is the 2-th day of the workweek.
Wednesday is the 3-th day of the workweek.
Thursday is the 4-th day of the workweek.
Friday is the 5-th day of the workweek.
```
