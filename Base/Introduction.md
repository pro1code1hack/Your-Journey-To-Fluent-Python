Introduction to Python
Python is an interpretable, high-level, platform-independent programming language.
This programming language is scriptable, which simplifies writing code for the programmer.
Python is a dynamic language that simplifies the writing of simple programs.
However, it causes some difficulties when writing complex programs.
Python is also a relatively slow programming language
In addition, you can download all versions of python because the first source is open to the public!
It is not for nothing that Python is used in such programs as Google Browser, YouTube, and even NASA.
Python is quite a versatile language, with its help you can write such things as:
system programming, graphical and web applications, as well as database applications. 
In addition, Python works perfectly and adapts to systems that were written in C++,
which expands the possibilities of its use.
Also, everyone who plans to program in Python must accept the philosophy of this programming language.

1.Beautiful is better than ugly;
2.Explicit is better than implicit;
3.Simple is better than complex;
4.Complex is better than complicated;
5.Flat is better than nested;
6.Sparse is better than dense;
7.Readability counts;
8.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules;
9.Although practicality beats purity;
10.Errors should never pass silently;
11.Unless explicitly silenced;
12.In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess;
13.There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it;
14.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch;
   15.Now is better than never;
16.Although never is often better than *right* now;
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea;
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea;
Namespaces are one honking great idea — let's do more of those!
