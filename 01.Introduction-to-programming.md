## 1. What is programming?

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. It’s like writing a recipe, but instead of making a cake, you’re creating different apps.

### 1.1 What can you do with programming?

Talking of all opportunities that are opened to you after learning how programming works, you will be able to do the following things:

1. **Solve Problems**: Programming can be used to model and solve complex problems in fields like `finance`, `engineering`, and `medicine`.

2. **Develop Software and Applications**: From the operating system on your computer to the apps on your phone, programming is the backbone of software development.

3. **Create Websites**: Web development involves programming both the visual `front-end` that users interact with and the `back-end` that processes data.

4. **Automate Tasks**: You can write `scripts` to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This could be anything from sorting files to generating reports.

5. **Analyze Data**: With programming, you can process large sets of data to find patterns and insights, a practice commonly known as `data science`.

6. **Build Games**: `Game development` is another avenue, where programming brings to life the mechanics, graphics, and interactivity of a game.

## 2.  Overview of Python

Choosing `Python` as your first language opens a world where coding is not just accessible but also very enjoyable and rewarding.

### 2.1 Sample Programs

Over its almost 30 years of existence, Python has become one of the [most popular](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) programming languages.

To give you the big picture, let’s take a look at some applications and companies who use this language on everyday basis

<img title="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Instagram_logo_2016.svg/2048px-Instagram_logo_2016.svg.png" alt="File:Instagram logo 2016.svg - Wikimedia Commons" width="122">     <img title="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Pinterest-logo.png" alt="File:Pinterest-logo.png - Wikimedia Commons" width="117">   <img title="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Spotify_App_Logo.svg/800px-Spotify_App_Logo.svg.png" alt="File:Spotify App Logo.svg - Wikipedia" width="118">  <img src="https://www.redditinc.com/assets/images/site/reddit-logo.png" title="" alt="Brand - Reddit" width="122"> <img src="https://img.freepik.com/premium-vector/red-youtube-logo-social-media-logo_197792-1803.jpg" title="" alt="Youtube Logo - Free Vectors & PSDs to Download" width="118">

Each of these application are using python in a certain way, and as you can see from the statistics it becomes much popular every day

## 3.  Python installation

### For `Windows` Users

**Step 1: Download Python**
- Visit the official Python website at python.org.
- Navigate to the Downloads section and download the latest version of Python for Windows.

**Step 2: Download Python**
- Run the Installer:
- Once the installer is downloaded, run it.
- _Make sure to check the box that says `"Add Python to PATH"` before installation._
- Click `"Install Now"` to start the installation process.


**Step 3: Verify the Installation**
- Open Command Prompt and type `python --version` and press `Enter`.
- If Python is installed correctly, you should see the version number.


### For `macOS`  Users

**Step 1: Download Python**
- Visit the official `Python` website at python.org.
- Under the Downloads section, choose the macOS version and download it.

**Step 2: Run the installer**
- Click `"Install Now"` to start the installation process.

**Step 3: Verify the Installation**
- Open `Terminal` and type `python --version` and press `Enter`.
- The version number should appear if the installation was successful.
 
## 4. IDE Installation (VSCode)

To start coding, we need two main things: a development environment where we can write our code, and the `Python` to execute it.

**Step 1: Downloading `VSCode`**

- Navigate to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Select the version that matches your operating system—Windows, Linux, or macOS are all supported.
- Click the download button and install IDE 

**Step 2: Installing Python in VSCode**

- Look for the Extensions icon on the left-hand sidebar—it looks like four squares with one square detached.
- Search for 'Python' and select the one published by Microsoft.
- Click 'Install' and give it a moment to set up.

**Step 3: Writing Your First Python Code**

- With the Python extension installed, you can now write Python code.
- Open a new file, save it with the `.py` extension, and start typing your Python program.
- You can run your code directly in VSCode. Just hit the green play button on the top right or press `F5`.

That’s it! You’ve set up your IDE, and you’re ready to dive into `Python` programming.

#### Output

```
python --version
Python 3.8.7
```

## 5. `print()`

The  `print()`  function is used in `Python` in order to send data to the console. This is the primary way to output data from your program to the user.

In order to see the printed statement, you have to run the code, otherwise it won't be executed and there will be nothing inside the console.

#### Example


```python
print("We are learning Python!")
```

Create a file `main.py`, save it in VScode (using shortcut Ctrl + s) or for Mac users (Cmd +s) and run the following command

```
python main.py
```

#### Output
```shell
We are learning Python!
```


**_NOTE_**: You can use the single quotes and the output will remain the same.

```python
print('We are learning Python!') == print("We are learning Python!") 
```

The `print()` command allows you to specify <span style="color:orange">multiple arguments</span> , in which case they must be separated by commas. If you leave out commas between arguments, Python will treat it as a syntax error.

#### Example

```python
print("I", "will" "become", "a" "software", "engineer")
```

#### Output
```shell
I will become a software engineer!
```

Each subsequent `print()` will create output the message on the next line

#### Example

```python
print("Hello")
print("World")
print("!")
```


#### Output

```shell
Hello
World
!
```

### 5.1 `print()` with and without arguments

The `print()` function with an empty argument list simply inserts a new empty line. 

#### Example

```python
print("What a lovely day!")
print()
print("Naah, I am too lazy to work, let's go to pub!")
```

#### Output

```
What a lovely day!

Naah, I am too lazy to work, let's go to pub!
```

### 5.2 `sep` and `end` arguments

The `print()` function in `Python` has optional arguments `sep` and `end` which offer _more control_ over the formatting of the output.


| Argument | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| sep | Specifies the separator _between_ the values. By default, it is a `space`. |
| end | Specifies what to print at the `end`. By default, it is a newline character `(\n)`.|


#### Example 

```python
# Case #1 -> dash symbol is added between all string we pass into print()
print("There", "are", "5", "apples", sep="-")

# Case #2 -> instead of printing ``world!`` on the new (separate) we print it within one line 
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("world!")

# Case #3 separate all worlds with a coma and add `and more` to the sentence 
print("Python", "Java", "C++", sep=", ", end=" ")
print("and more!")
```

#### Output

```
# Case #1
There-are-5-apples

# Case #2 
Hello world!

# Case #3 
Python, Java, C++, and more!
```

### 5.3 Escaping characters
In Python, certain characters can be 'escaped' to achieve special formatting in strings. 

| Escape Sequence | Meaning                               |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| `\n`            | `Newline` - moves to the next line      |
| `\t`            | `Horizontal Tab` - adds a tab space     |
| `\\`            | `Backslash` - to use a backslash itself |
| `\'`            | `Single Quote`                          |
| `\"`            | `Double Quote `                         |

#### Example 
```python
print("This is a line.\nAnd this is another line.")
print("Name:\tJohn")
print("Path to the folder: C:\\Users\\John")
```

#### Output
```
This is a line.
And this is another line.
Name:   John
Path to the folder: C:\Users\John
```
## 6. `input()`

>The main goal as a software engineer is to make an _`interactive`_ application which is user friendly and matches the highest standarts in the world of programming.

The `input()` function in `Python` allows your program to collect data entered by the user. This function waits for the user to type something into the console and then press `Enter [↵]`.

It treats the incoming data as a `string` (`str`) and can be stored in a _variable_ for further use.

In `Python`, declaring variables is pretty straightforward,  you just need to assign a value to a variable with the equals sign `(=)` 

#### Example
```python
print("Hello, what is your name?")
      
# At this stage the program is awaiting the input from user which we store in the variable called ``name`` and we can use it later
name = input()
print('Hello,', name, "it is nice to see you!")
```

#### Explanation

In the example above we can see that the program is executed line by line, because `Python` is an interpreted language and it is very important to understand, that before executing the line  `Hello <name>, it is nice to see you!` it freezes, until the user is prompted to input their `name`


#### Output
```
Hello, what is your name?
>> (Adam)
Hello Adam, it is nice to see you!
```

### 6.2 Rules how to name variables

- Use only letters `(a-z, A-Z)`, `digits`, and `underscores (_)`.
- A variable name <span style="color:red">cannot start with a digit.<span>
- The name <span style="color:green"> must ideally reflect its purpose.<span>
- Remember, <span style="color:orange"> Python is case-sensitive<span>: `name` and `Name` are <span style="color:red">different variables.<span>
- The convention is to use `lower_case_with_underscores`.


### 6.3 Assignments

#### Assignment 1: Personalized Greeting
