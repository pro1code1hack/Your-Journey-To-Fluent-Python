## 1. (`int` and `float`)

Variables in Python are like containers for storing data values. Python has various data types including integers, float (decimal numbers), strings, and boolean values.

### 1.1 int

Integers are the data type used to represent <span style="color:orange">whole numbers</span>. Unlike `strings`, integers _are not_ surrounded by quotes.

In order to check what is the type of the variable we can use function `type()` and print its output.

#### Example

```python
# Int
number_of_apples = 5
my_age = 22

print("There are", number_of_apples, "apples in the basket")
print(type(number_of_apples)) 
print("My age is:", my_age)
print(type(my_age))
```

#### Output
```python
The are 5 apples in the basket
<class 'int'>
My age is: 22
<class 'int'>
```

As `Python` is a dynamical language (it means that the programmer doesn't declare types _explicitly_), this can cause some issues in the future with advanced data types. So if you are not sure what type is stored in the variable, don't hesitate to call `type()`.

### 1.1 float

Floats are numbers that have a _decimal point_. They can show fractions as well as whole numbers, like the change you get back from a dollar or how much of a cake is left. 

Sometimes, you'll see really big or small floats written with an "e" which is just a shortcut way of writing zeros.

#### Example

```python
# Float
apple_price = 0.99

print("Apple price:", apple_price, "dollars")
print("Type of apple_price variable:", type(apple_price))
```

#### Output
```python
Apple price: 0.99 pounds
Type of apple_price variable: <class 'float'>
```

## 2. Math operations

In `Python`, you can perform _all_ the basic mathematical operations you're familiar with from arithmetic. 

This includes `addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, `division`, and even more complex operations like `exponentiation`.


Here is a table that describes each operator.


| Operator      | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
|       +       |   addition  |
|       -       |   subtraction  |
|       *       |   multiplication  |
|       /       |   division (always returns a float) |
|       //      |   Floor division (divides and rounds down to nearest integer) |
|       **      |   Exponentiation (raises a number to the power of another)    |
|       %       |   Modulo (gives the remainder of a division)                  |


#### Example

```python
# Two numbers
num1 = 15
num2 = 4

# Operations
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
division_result = num1 / num2
integer_division_result = num1 // num2
exponentiation_result = num1 ** num2
modulo_result = num1 % num2

# Displaying the results
print("Addition of", num1, "and", num2, "=", sum_result)
print("Subtraction of", num1, "from", num2, "=", difference_result)
print("Division of", num1, "by", num2, "=", division_result)
print("Integer division of", num1, "by", num2, "=", integer_division_result)
print("Exponentiation of", num1, "to the power of", num2, "=", exponentiation_result)
print("Modulo of", num1, "by", num2, "=", modulo_result)
```

#### Output

```python
Addition of 15 and 4 = 19
Subtraction of 15 from 4 = 11
Division of 15 by 4 = 3.75
Integer division of 15 by 4 = 3
Exponentiation of 15 to the power of 4 = 50625
Modulo of 15 by 4 = 3
```

Here is a practical task, which you may remember from school, where we need to calculate the `area` and `circumference` of a circle.

#### Example

```python
# Constants
PI = 3.14159

# Radius of a circle
radius = 5

# Calculating area (PI * r^2)
area = PI * (radius ** 2)

# Calculating circumference (2 * PI * r)
circumference = 2 * PI * radius

print("Given a circle with a radius of:", radius)
print("Area of the circle:", area)
print("Circumference of the circle:", circumference)
```

#### Output
```python
Given a circle with a radius of: 5
Area of the circle: 78.53975
Circumference of the circle: 31.4159
```

## 3. (`str` and `bool`)

### 3.1 String Data Type (`str`)

A string in `Python` is a _series of characters_. It is used to represent text. 

As you know already, strings in `Python` are enclosed either in single quotes `(')` or double quotes `(")`, and they can include _letters_, _numbers_, and _various symbols_. Also when we ask a user for input, we store the input provided by the user into a `str` type variable.

#### Example
```python    
# String Examples
greeting = "Hello, Python learners!"
course_name = 'The best Python Course in the United Kingdom, or even in the whole world!'
student_name = input("Input your name:")

print(greeting)
print("The course you are taking is called:", course_name)
print("Name of the student is", student_name)
```

#### Output

```python
Input your name:
>> Adam
Hello, Python learners!
The course you are taking is called: The best Python Course in the United Kingdom, or even in the whole world!
Name of the student is Adam
```

### 3.2 Boolean Data Type (`bool`)

`Boolean/bool`, is a data type that can only have two values: `True` or `False`. 

Booleans are often the result of `comparisons` or `conditions` in Python and are _**extremely** **important** for decision-making in code_.

#### Example

```python    
is_student = True
is_weekend = False

print("Is student:", is_student)
print("Is it the weekend:", is_weekend)
```

#### Output

```python
Is student: True
Is it the weekend: False
```

## 4. Converting data types

In all programming languages, sometimes there is a need to convert data from one type to another. This process is known as type _conversion_ or _typecasting_. 

It's especially important when the data type of a value <span style="color:red">is not suitable for a specific operation</span>. 

### 4.1 Implicit Conversion

In this example, `Python` automatically converts data types after an arithmetical operation.

#### Example

```python
num_int = 6      # Integer type
num_float = 1.5  # Float type

# Python automatically converts num_int to a float
total = num_int + num_float

print("Total:", total)
print("Type of total:", type(total))
```

#### Output

```python
Total: 7.5
Type of total: <class 'float'>
```

### 4.2 Explicit Conversion

Explicit conversion requires the programmer to convert data types manually. Python provides functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc..  <span style="color:orange">for explicit conversions. <span>

There are several examples provided below that explain the need of such conversations.

If we try to apply math operations to strings, it will result in an error:  

#### Incorrect Usage 

Avoid doing this!

```python
# Both variables are of type 'str' (string)
salary = "1000"
tax = "200"

# Attempting to subtract/multiply/divide two strings - will cause an error!!
net_income = salary - tax
print("Net income: ", net_income)
```

#### Output

```python
ERROR!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 5, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
```

**Note:** In such cases we would want to convert the `types` of variables.

#### Correct Usage

This is a recommended approach.

```python
# These variables are ``strings`` representing ``numbers``
salary_str = "1000"
tax_str = "200"

# Converting ``str`` variables to ``int``
salary_int = int(salary_str)
tax_int = int(tax_str)

# Now we can perform the subtraction with ``int`` variables
net_income = salary - tax
print("Net income: ", net_income)
```

#### Output
```
Net income: 800
```

We can convert `user's` input into the integers while using `input()` function.

#### Example 


```python
# Asking the user to input their age and converting it into the integer 
age= int(input("Please enter your age: "))

print("Type of age is: ", type(age))
print("You are", age, "years old.")
```

#### Output

```
Please enter your age:
>> 21

Type of age is:  <class 'int'>
You are 21 years old.
```
