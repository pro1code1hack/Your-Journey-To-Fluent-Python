## 1 Mutable and Immutable data types

>Mutable data types - are those that **_can be changed after they are created_**. 

This means you can `change`, `add`, or `remove` elements from these data types **_without creating a new object_**.

In programming, understanding the difference between `mutable` and `immutable` data types is <span style="color:red">_extremely_ crucial</span> because it affects how you work with data and how your program behaves.

This lesson we will be focusing on the `list`. But during next lessons we will get acquainted with `tuple`, `set` and `dict` data structures. So it will be the best to know which of them are `mutable/immutable` now. 

### 1.1 Mutable  

| Data Structure | Description                                 | Example Operations                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `List`              | Ordered and changeable collection of items  | `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`      |
| `Dictionary`        | Unordered collection of key-value pairs     | `update()`, `clear()`, `pop()`         |
| `Set`               | Unordered collection of unique items        | `add()`, `discard()`, `pop()`        |


### 1.2 Immutable 

> Immutable data types cannot be changed after their creation. Any "modification" _**creates a new object**_ instead of changing the old one.

|Data Type | Description                          | Example Operations                                     |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `Tuple`               | Ordered and unchangeable collection  | Accessing items, `index()`, `count()`                  |
| `String`              | Sequence of characters               | Accessing characters, concatenation creates new string |
| `Integer`             | Whole number without decimal         | Arithmetic operations create new integers              |
| `Float`               | Number with decimal point            | Arithmetic operations create new floats                |
| `Boolean`             | Represents `True` or `False`             | Used in logical operations                             |

We have already seen the error trying to modify strings in the Lesson #3. Instead of this we created a _**new**_ variable to store a _**new**_ object. 

#### Example 

```python
greeting = "Hello, world!"
print(f"Original string: {greeting}")

# Attempting to change a character
greeting[0] = 'J'       # This line will actually raise an error: TypeError

# Concatenation creates a new string and
greeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
print(f"Modified string: {greeting}")
```

#### Output

```
Original string: Hello, world!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 5, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

But how to verify if we created a new object? This can be done using `id()` function.

### 1.3 `id()` 

The `id()` function in `Python` returns a _**unique identifier for an object**_, which corresponds to its location in memory. Actually, almost any operation that seems to modify the object actually creates a new object, if you work with **_immutable_** objest.

If the `id()` is different, it confirms that a new object was created. This can be helpful while debugging the project.

#### Example
```python
# Immutable data type
greeting = "Hello, world!"
original_id = id(greeting)

greeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
new_id = id(greeting)

# Comparing identifiers
print(f"Original ID: {original_id}")
print(f"Modified ID: {new_id}")
```

#### Output
```
Original ID: 140353776296400
Modified ID: 140353776295680
```

## 2. Introduction to `list`

In `Python` a `list` - is a _mutable, ordered sequence of items_. 

It is one of the most versatile data types and can contain items of different data types, though typically, lists contain items of the same type.

### 2.1 Syntax 

In order to create an empty `list` we can use the following syntax:

#### Example
```python
list_1 = []
list_2 = list()

print(list_1, list_2)
print(type(list_1), type(list_2))
```

#### Output

```
[] []
<class 'list'> <class 'list'>
```

### 2.2 Data Type Conversion

Most `iterable types` in `Python` can be converted to a list using the list constructor.

Simply speaking, `iterable types` - objects that can give you elements one by one, which allows you to iterate through them using loops or advanced techniques such as iterators/generators.

#### Example

```python
string_to_list = list('hello')
print(string_to_list)
```

#### Output
```
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

### 2.3 Indexing and slicing

> `Indexing` and slicing `work` the same way for `lists` as they do with `strings`. 

`Indexing` -> access _individual_ items. 

`slicing` -> access _a range of_ items.

#### Example

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Indexing
print(my_list[1])  # 20

# Slicing
print(my_list[1:4])  # [20, 30, 40]
```

### 2.4 Concatenation

`Lists` can be concatenated using the `+` operator, which combines them into a new list.

#### Example 
```python
list_one = [1, 2, 3]
list_two = [4, 5, 6]
list_three = [7, 8, 9]

# Concat
new_list = list_one + list_two + list_three
print(new_list)  
```

#### Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```


### 2.5 Multiplication
In `Python`, lists can be _multiplied by an integer_, _which repeats the list's elements_.


#### Example 

```python
# Example 1
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
new_numbers = numbers * 3 
print(new_numbers)

# Example 2 
names = ["Sasha", "Yehor"]
triple_names = names * 3
print(triple_names)
```

#### Output 

```
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
['Sasha', 'Yehor', 'Sasha', 'Yehor', 'Sasha', 'Yehor']
```

In some cases this can be very useful and it's very cool that `Python` provides such functionality.

### 2.6 Operators `+=` / `*=` and unpacking

The `+=` and `*=` operators can modify lists in place. These operators perform the same operations as `list + list` and `list * int`. respectively.

#### Example

```python
#  +=
nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums += [4, 5]  # Same as ``nums = nums + [4,5]``
print(nums)

# *= 
nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums *= 2  # Same as ``nums = nums * 2``
print(nums)
```

#### Output

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

### 2.7 Unpacking

Unpacking is the way of extracting values from iterable objects. 

There are several types of unpacking presented in `Python`. 


### 2.7.1 Basic Unpacking

The number of variables _on the left side of the assignment operator_ **should match** _the number of elements in the iterable_.

#### Example

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
a, b, c = my_list  # Unpacking list into three variables
print(a)  # 1
print(b)  # 2
print(c)  # 3
```

### 2.7.2 Extended Unpacking

Using a star `*` expression, a.k.a (`asterix`), allows you to assign _a portion of an iterable to a variable_ and _the rest to another variable_.

#### Output
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
first, *middle, last = my_list
print(first)   # 1
print(middle)  # [2, 3, 4]
print(last)    # 5
```

### 2.7.3  Swapping Variables

This lifehack  can be used to swap the values of two variables efficiently without needing a temporary variable.

#### Example
```python
x, y = 10, 20
x, y = y, x  # Swapping values
print(x)  # 20
print(y)  # 10
```

#### 2.7.4 Unpacking with ``for`` 

As it was mentioned before, `list` can consist of different types of elements and it being  a `list` of lists. That's where nested loops come in handy. Alternatively, you can use that to upack variables with the same format. 

#### Example
```python
nested_lists = [[1, 'apple'], [2, 'banana'], [3, 'cherry']]
for number, fruit in nested_lists:
    print(f"Number: {number}, Fruit: {fruit}")
```

#### Output

```
Number: 1, Fruit: apple
Number: 2, Fruit: banana
Number: 3, Fruit: cherry
```

### 2.8 Operator `in`

The in operator in Python is used to check if a value exists within all `iterable objects`.

#### Example 

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'banana']
print(3 in my_list)  # True
print(6 in my_list)  # False
print("banana" in my_list) # True
print("a" in my_list[-1]) # True
```

## 3. Functions (`len()`, `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, `sorted()`)

Python provides several `built-in` functions that are readily available for common list operations. These functions can quickly perform actions on list items without the need for `loops`.


They work with _all iterables_ beause they use `polymorphism` concept which we will explore in OOP (Object Oriented Programming).

### 3.1 `len()`

The `len()` function returns the number of items in a list (the length of the list). 

#### Example 
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(len(numbers)) 

matrix = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]     # we have 2 lists in the list, heh
print(len(matrix))
```

#### Output
```
5
2
```

### 3.2 `sum()`

The `sum()` function calculates the total sum of **_all numerical_** items in a list.

#### Example 

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum(numbers))

# This won't work, as we need only ``numberical data types``
imposter_numbers = ["STRING???", 15]
print(sum(imposter_numbers))
```

#### Output
```
15
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 5, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```
 
### 3.3 `min()`

The `min()` function returns the smallest item in a list.

#### Example

```python
numbers = [5, 1, 8, 3, 2]
print(min(numbers))

# This won't work, as well
imposter_numbers = [[1, 2, 3], 15]
print(min(imposter_numbers))
```

#### Output

```
1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'list' and 'int'
```

### 3.4 `max()`

The `max()` function returns the biggest item in a list.


#### Example

```python
numbers = [5, 1, 8, 3, 2]
print(max(numbers))  # Output: 8

# Nope, won't work, don't even try to do this!
imposter_numbers = ['s', 15]
print(min(imposter_numbers))
```

#### Output

```
8
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'list' and 'int'
```

## 4. Methods of Lists

Suppose we have the following `list`:

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
```

### 4.1 Adding Elements

These methods let you add elements to the list, either at the end, a specific position, or extending the list by appending all elements from another iterable
(`str`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, etc..) / numbers.


| Method          | Description                                        | Example                         | Output                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `append(x)`     | Adds an item to the end of the list.               | `x.append(4)`                 | `[1, 2, 3, 4]`                |
| `extend(iterable)` | Extends the list by appending elements from the `iterable`. | `x.extend([5, 6])`        | `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`          |
| `insert(i, x)`  | Inserts an item at a given position.               | `x.insert(2, 'a')`            | `[1, 2, 'a', 3, 4]`           |


### 4.2 Removing Elements
| Method          | Description                                        | Example                         | Output                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `remove(x)`     | Removes the first item from the list whose value is x. | `x.remove('a')`              | `[1, 2, 3, 4]`                |
| `pop([i])`      | Removes the item at the given position in the list, and returns it. | `x.pop(1)`                   | `[1, 3, 4]`                   |
| `clear()`       | Removes all items from the list.                   | `x.clear()`                   | `[]`                          |


### 4.3 Utility Methods
| Method          | Description                                        | Example                         | Output                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `index(x)`      | Returns the index of the first item whose value is x. | `x.index(3)`                 | `2`                           |
| `count(x)`      | Returns the number of times x appears in the list. | `x.count(1)`                    | `1`                           |
| `sort()`        | Sorts the items of the list in place.              | `x.sort()`                      | `[1, 2, 3, 4]`                |
| `reverse()`     | Reverses the elements of the list in place.        | `x.reverse()`                   | `[4, 3, 2, 1]`                |
| `copy()`        | Returns a _shallow copy_ of the list.              | `new_x = x.copy()`              | `new_x` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`   |

Don't hesitate to use `dir()`, and `help()` functions or refer to the official `Python` documentation working with list.

## 5. General methods of Iterations 

Iterating through lists is a fundamental aspect of working with data in `Python`, as it allows you to access and manipulate each item in a list. 

As with strings, `Python` provides several ways to iterate over lists.

### 5.1 Using `for in` Loop

The `for in` loop is the most common way to iterate through each item in a list directly.

#### Example

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

#### Output 

```
apple
banana
cherry
```


#### Example
```python
cities = ['London', 'Kyiv', 'Washington']
for city in cities:
    print(city)
```

#### Output

```
London
Kyiv
Washington
```

Don't forget to call variables which  make sense for data scructures like in the examples above. 

### 5.2 Using `for index in range(len(list))`

Sometimes, you need the index of the items while iterating through a list. In this case, you can use `range()` along with `len()` to iterate through the list indexes.


#### Example

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for index in range(len(fruits)):
    print(f"Index: {index}, Fruit: {fruits[index]}")
```

#### Output 

```
Index: 0, Fruit: apple
Index: 1, Fruit: banana
Index: 2, Fruit: cherry
```

This method is useful when you need to modify the list items since you can use the index to set new values.


## 6. Copying lists  

Ccpying lists can be tricky, especially for beginners, because of the way Python handles object references. 

There are two primary ways how we can `copy` list objects:

### 6.1 Shallow Copying

Shallow copying <span style="color:orange">_**creates a new list object**_</span>, but <span style="color:red">it **doesn't** create **new objects** for the elements **inside the list**</span>. It only copies references to those elements.

Be carefull using this copying.

#### Example

```python
original_list = [1, 2, 3]
copied_list = original_list.copy()

print("Original List:", id(original_list))
print("Copied List:", id(copied_list))
```

In this case, `original_list` and `copied_list` have different ids, <span style="color:green">meaning they are different objects</span>. 

#### Output

```
Original List: 139827368587200
Copied List: 139827364976256
```

However, the elements **inside them** are <span style="color:red">still referencing the same objects</span>.

#### Example

```python 
print(id(original_list[1]))
print(id(copied_list[1]))
```

#### Output

```
139827364976123
139827364976123
```

### 6.2  Assigning a reference

Assigning a reference to a list in `Python` is an operation that can lead to _**unintended consequences**_. It's often confused with creating a copy of the list, but in reality, it's quite different.


#### Example 

What Happens When You Assign a Reference?

```python
original_list = [1, 2, 3]
reference_list = original_list    # assign a list to one and another variable

# Output the ids
print("Original_list_id: ", id(original_list))
print("Reference_list_id: ", id(reference_list))

# Made a change to both ``original_list`` and ``reference_list`` 
original_list += [4]
reference_list += [5] 

# Output lists
print("Original List:", original_list)
print("Reference List:", reference_list)
```

<span style="color:red">Any changes made to `original_list` will also appear in `reference_list`, and vice versa</span>. This is because they are <span style="color:red">**two names for the same object.**</span>

If your intention was to work with two separate lists, this behavior could lead to bugs. Changes you thought were made to only one list can unexpectedly affect the other.

#### Output

```
Original_list_id:  140583473131392
Reference_list_id:  140583473131392

Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reference List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### 6.3  Deep Copying Lists

Imagine, you have lists containing other mutable objects (e.g list of lists), it's crucial to understand the concept of `deep copying`, when working with more complex data structures.

A `deep copy` creates a new list with entirely new objects, **_even for nested mutable objects_**.


###  How it works?

1. `Creating a New List`: <span style="color:orange">**_A completely new list object_**</span> is created.
2. `Copying Nested Objects`: Even the <span style="color:orange">**_nested objects within the list are copied and recreated_**</span> in the new list.
3. `Independent Objects`: Changes made to the deep-copied list (or its nested objects) <span style="color:orange">**_do not affect the original list, and vice versa._**</span>

#### Example

```python
"""Python provides a module named `copy`, which has a method `deepcopy()` for this purpose."""

import copy

# Original list with nested mutable objects
original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

# Creating a deep copy
deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list)

# Modifying the deep copied list
deep_copied_list[0][1] = 'Changed'

print("Original List:", original_list)
print("Deep Copied List:", deep_copied_list)
```

#### Output

```
Original List: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
Deep Copied List: [[1, 'Changed', 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```
Deep copying is more memory-intensive and can be slower for large lists. So use it wisely. For example, when your list contains `nested mutable objects`, and you `need complete independence between the original and copied data`.

### 7. List comprehantions

List comprehensions provide a more readable and concise way to create lists by transforming each element of an iterable.

They can be used in place of for loops for simplicity and efficiency, particularly when you're applying a single, straightforward transformation or condition to each element. Btw, they work faster than default loops.

### 7.1 Syntax

```python
# Default option 
[expression for item in iterable]

# If clause
[expression for item in iterable if condition]

# If-else clause
[if expression else expression for item in itreable]
```

Basically it is the same as for loops and each `list comprehension` _can be rewriten_ into the `for` loop.

#### Example

```python
# List comprehension
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(5)]

# For loop equivalant
squares = []
for i in range(5):
    squares.append(i ** 2)
```

#### Output 
```
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

#### Example
```python
# List comprehension
even_squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0]


# For loop
even_squares = []
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        even_squares.append(i ** 2)
```

#### Output 
```
[0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```

#### Example

```python
# List comprehension
even_or_odd = ["even" if i % 2 == 0 else "odd" for i in range(5)]

# For loop
even_or_odd = []
for i in range(5):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        even_or_odd.append("even")
    else:
        even_or_odd.append("odd")
```



#### Output 

```
["even", "odd", "even", "odd", "even"]
```

But there is some known rules between programers where we <span style="color:green">should</span> or <span style="color:red"> shouldn't </span> use them. 

In some cases for simple operation it is a great tool which working much faster in terms of efficiency, but in other cases it can lead to unnecessary complexion which will result in bad maintainability and readability of the code.  

Please, be careful using list comprehesnsions.


### 7.2 For-Loop vs List Comprehension

| | `Loops` | `List Comprehension` |
|---|---|---|
| **Advantages** | - More flexible<br>- Easier to read with complex logic<br>- Allows complex operations | - More concise and readable for simple cases<br>- Can be written as a single line<br>- Often faster for creating a list |
| **Disadvantages** | - Can be verbose for simple operations | - Can be less readable with complex expressions<br>- Not suitable for multi-step operations |
| **When to Use** | - When you have complex logic<br>- When the loop involves nested loops, conditions, or other complex operations | - When you're applying a single operation to all items<br>- When you need a quick and readable one-liner to create/update a list |


**Note:** Always prioritize _<span style="color:green">readability</span>_ and _<span style="color:green">maintainability</span>_ of your code when choosing between a `for-loop` and a `list comprehension`.


## 8. `join()` and `split()`

In Python, `join()` and `split()` are two powerful methods that bridge the gap between `strings` and `lists`. They are widely used in data manipulation, especially in tasks involving _text processing_ and _data formatting_.

### 8.1 `join()`

The `join()` method in `Python` is a _`string`_ method that takes all items in an iterable and joins them into one string. 


```python
words = ['Python', 'is', 'extremly', 'powerful', 'and', 'complicated' 'language']
s = ' '.join(words)
print(s)
```

#### Output

```
Python is extremly powerful and complicated language
# I'm kidding Assembler is harder :)
```

A string can be specified as the separator, by default it is a `whitespace` as you have seen from the example above.

#### Example  
```python
separator = ', '
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
joined_string = separator.join(my_list)
print(joined_string)
```

#### Output
```
apple, banana, cherry
```

### 8.2 `split()`

The `split()` method _splits a string into a list where each word is a list item_.

The splitting is done at the specified separator. If no separator is defined, `whitespace` is used by default.

#### Example

```python
text = 'apple, banana, cherry'
split_list = text.split(', ')
print(split_list)
```

#### Output
```
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

#### Example 

```python
text = 'one two three four'
split_text = text.split(' ', 2) # You can the max number of splits as well.
print(split_list)
```

#### Output

```
['one', 'two', 'three four']
```

These methods are especially powerful when used together, allowing for back-and-forth transformations between `strings` and `lists`.

## 10. Homework

### Task 1: List Manipulator

**Objective:** Create a program that allows the user to manipulate a list in various ways. The user can choose to `add`, `remove`, or `modify` items in the `list`.

```
# Example of how the program should work

# Menu:
# 1. Add an item
# 2. Remove an item
# 3. Modify an item

# User chooses option 1:
Enter the item to add: Apple
Output: List: ['Apple']

# User chooses option 2:
Enter the item to remove: Apple
Output: List: []

# User chooses option 3:
Enter the item to modify: Apple
Enter the new item: Banana
Output: List: ['Banana']
```

### Task 2: Slicer and Dicer

**Objective:**  Develop a program that allows users to `input` a `list` and then perform various `slicing operations` based on the user `input`.


```python
Input:
Enter a list of numbers (separated by space): 10 20 30 40 50
Enter start index for slicing: 1
Enter stop index for slicing: 4

Output:
The sliced list is: [20, 30, 40]
```


### Task 3: Shopping List Organizer

**Objective:**  Develop a program that helps users organize their shopping list by `adding`, `viewing`, `removing` and `sort` items alphabetically.

Additionaly, we would want to check if we add strings to the list. You can use `isinstance()` function documented [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance).

```python
# Example of how the program should work

# Menu:
# 1. Add item
# 2. View list
# 3. Remove item
# 4. Exit

# User Interaction Example:
Choose an action (add/view/remove/exit): add
Enter an item to add: Milk
Item added. Your current list is: ['Milk']

Choose an action (add/view/remove/exit): add
Enter an item to add: Eggs
Item added. Your current list is: ['Eggs', 'Milk']

Choose an action (add/view/remove/exit): add
Enter an item to add: 25
Sorry, it is not a string

Choose an action (add/view/remove/exit): view
Shopping List: ['Eggs', 'Milk']

Choose an action (add/view/remove/exit): remove
Enter an item to remove: Milk
Item removed. Your current list is: ['Apples']

Choose an action (add/view/remove/exit): exit
Exiting the program.

# Don't forget to check if item exists in the list using operator ``in``
```

### Task 4: Average of Evens

**Objective:** Generate a list of even elements using range from the input and display the average of them.

```python
# Write a list comprehension here:
```


### Task 5: List of numbers operations

**Objective:**  Enhance the provided code to perform the following actions on a given `list`:

- Display the length of the `list`.
- Print the `sum`, `max`, `min` and the average.
- Print the last element of the `list`.
- Output the `list` in `reverse` order (remember to use `slicing`).
- Print `"YES"` if the list contains the numbers `4` and `9`, and `"NO"` otherwise.
- Show the list with the `first` and `last` elements removed (create a new list object instead).
- Print the third element from the end of the list.
- If the second element `is > 10`, replace it with 10.

```
# Sample List
numbers = [3, 12, 5, 8, 4, 9, 15, 22]

# Your code here
```

### Task 6: ASCII alphabet

**Objective:**  Write a program which creates alphabet and stores it into the `list`.

```
# Output
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
```

### Task 7: Mini Database

**Objective:** Develop a program that stores detailed information about a person using nested lists.

```python
Input:
Enter your name: Alice
Enter your age: 30
Enter your hobbies (separated by commas): reading, gardening, gaming
Enter your favorite foods (separated by commas): pizza, salad, ice cream

Output:
Personal Information: 
Name: Alice
Age: 30
Hobbies: ['reading', 'gardening', 'gaming']
Favorite Foods: ['pizza', 'salad', 'ice cream']

# Later on, the program can provide options to view, update and remove these details.
```

### Task 8: Validating IP Addresses


**Objective:** Write a program that validates if the entered string is a correct IP address.

**Note**: An IP address is considered valid if it consists of four non-negative integers separated by dots, with each integer ranging from 0 to 254 inclusive.

```python
## Example
Input: 192.168.1.1
Output: Correct

Input: 256.300.2.10
Output: Incorrect
```

### Task 9: Email Extractor

**Objective:** Create a program to extract email addresses from a block of text. The program should identify strings that resemble email addresses and separate them using semicolons.

```
# Input:
Enter the text: Please contact us at support@example.com or sales@example.com for assistance.

# Output:
Extracted Emails: support@example.com; sales@example.com
```

Don't forget that while designing your program, remember to create an interactive and user-friendly interface!
