# OOP

_Object Oriented Programming is considered as a design
for building software. In OOP every logic is written to get
our work done, but represented in form of Objects._

_The basic goal of OOPs concepts with real time examples is to
connect data and the functions that operate on it so that no other
part of the code may access it except that function._

### Why classes?

+ You need to keep state

_For example, if you need to manage a bunch of students and grades, or when you build a game that keeps track of
attempts, score, etc_

+ Bigger projects – classes favor code organization and reusability

_This becomes specially powerful if you have hundreds of subclasses and you need to make a fundamental change. You can
make a single change in the base class (parent) and all child classes pick up the change (keeping things DRY)._

_Overall, Classes are a way to organize your code into generic, reusable pieces. At their best they are generic
blueprints for things that will be used over and over again with little modification._

# Concept of OOP

_Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming:_

+ Class
+ Objects
+ Methods
+ Inheritance
+ Encapsulation
+ Polymorphism

### Class

_Instead of writing a program, you create classes with OOP.
Data and functions are both contained in a class. You construct an object
, which is an instance of that class, when you want to save something in memory.
As an example, you can create a Customer class that contains customer-related data
and functions. You must then build a new Customer class object if you want
your program to generate a customer in memory._

_Consider the Automobile Class. There may be many automobiles with different
names and brands, but they will all have some basic characteristics, such as
four wheels, a speed limit, and a range of mileage. The class is Car, and the
attributes are wheels, speed limitations, and mileage._

+ Example:

```python
class Animals:
    '''This is a docstring. I have created a new class'''
    pass
```

### Objects

_Object is the basic unit of object-oriented programming.Objects are identified
by its unique name. An objectrepresents a particular instance of a class. There
can be more than one instance of an object. Each instance of an object can hold
its own relevant data._

+ Example:

```python
obj = Animals()
```

_A class creates a local namespace where all its attributes are defined. Attributes may be data or functions._
_As soon as we define a class, a new class object is created with the same name. This class object allows to access
the different attributes as well as to instantiate new objects of that class._

### Methods

_Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to define the behaviors of an object._

+ Example:

```python
class Animals:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name}({self.age})"


# instantiate the object
dog = Animals("Rex", 8)

# call our instance methods
print(dog)
```

### Self

_self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” we can access the attributes and methods of the class in
python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments._

### Comparison with Functional Programming

| Functional programming writes pure functions. Pure functions only produce outputs with identical inputs. Consequently, functional programming is extremely operational, practical, and, as the name indicates, functional. | OOP is not as operational as Functional programming. In fact, OOP stores data in objects, and the data is prioritized over the operations. |
| Functional programming uses immutable data                                                                                                                                                                                 | Object oriendet uses the mutable data                                                                                                      |
