## 1. Introduction to loops

Let's take a look on `while` loop. It runs until the condition for the loop is `True`.

### 1.1 Syntax

```python
while condition:
    # Code to execute while the condition is True
```

### 1.1 Practical Use Cases

**Scenario #1**:  Validation of the user input.

#### Example
```python
# The loop keeps asking for input until the user enters a positive number.

number = 0
while number <= 0:
    number = int(input("Enter a number > 0: "))   # Note: that indent is required to use ``while``

# Exit the loop in case we entered the ``number > 0``
print(f"Your number is > 0 and it is {number}")
```

#### Output
```
Enter a number > 0: -2
Enter a number > 0: 0
Enter a number > 0: 11

Your number is > 0 and it is 11
```

**Scenario #2**:  Repeat until specific input

#### Example
```python
response = ''
while response.lower() != 'exit':
    response = input("Type 'exit' to stop: ")
print("Exited successfully!")
```

#### Output
```
Type 'exit' to stop: what?
Type 'exit' to stop: I don't understand
Type 'exit' to stop: exit
Exited successfully!
```

`Loops` are extremely powerfull tools in programming languages and the examples provided are not _single possible_. Be creative! And come up with solutions,which will satisfy your needs!

### 1.2 `while` vs `for()`

- `while` loops are best used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.
- `for` loops are ideal when iterating over a sequence or range.

The table provided below helps to make a decision based on the appropriatness of usage `for` and `while`

| Aspect       | `while`                                     | `for`                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Control      | Based on a boolean condition.                    | Based on iterating over a sequence.     |
| Usage        | Unknown number of iterations.                    | Known number of iterations.             |
| Flexibility  | More flexible, can lead to infinite loops.       | Less prone to errors, more structured.  |

Sometimes we can achieve the identical result using either `while` or `for` loops, but with different syntax. 

#### Example

```python
counter = 0             # Define a counter 
while counter < 5:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1        # Each iteration add ``1`` to its value

# Add empty line between outputs
print()

# The ``for`` loop serves the same purpose as `while`
for counter in range(5):
    print(counter)    
```

#### Output 

```
0
1
2
3
4

0
1
2
3
4
```

### 1.3 Infinite loop

Infinite loops occur when the <span style="color:orange">loop condition _is always_ `True` </span>. <span style="color:red">They should be used extremely cautiously.</span> As this can block the program from `I/O` (`input/output`) operations.

Make sure that you always `exit` the infinite `loop` based on some conditions, using the `break` keyword described in section `2`.

#### Example

```python
while True:
    print("This loop will run forever...")
```

#### Output

```
# The program prints "This loop will run forever..." indefinitely
```

## 2. `break`, `continue`, and `else` in Loops

Loops in Python can be controlled using `break`, `continue`, and `else` statements. These control statements help in managing loop execution more precisely based on certain conditions.

| Keyword   | Description                                                   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `break`   | Exits the loop immediately, skipping the remaining iterations.|
| `continue`| Skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.   |
| `else`    | Executes a block of code after the loop completes normally.    |

### 2.1 `break`

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.

### When to use:

- To stop the loop when a specific condition occurs.
- In search operations when the item is found.
- To avoid unnecessary processing once the goal is achieved.


#### Example (`for`)

**_Objective_**: We want to exit the loop once number equals to 5.

```python
for number in range(10):
    if number == 5:
        break
    print(number)
```

It is important to understand, that we can use these keywords, in any type of loop we want. And put the condition which suits the technical task.

#### Example (`while`)

```python
count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        break
```

#### Output
```
0
1
2
3
4       
```

### 2.2 `continue`

The `continue` is used to skip the rest of the loop block and move to the next iteration.

### When to use:

- To skip specific iterations that do not meet certain criteria.
- To avoid executing certain parts of the loop for specific conditions.

#### Example (`for`)

**_Objective_**: We want to output only odd numbers within `range(0,10)`.

```python
for number in range(10):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        continue             # Skip the iteration once we meet the criteria in ``if`` statement
    print(number)
```

#### Example (`while`)
```python
count = 0
while count < 10:
    count += 1
    if count % 2 == 0:
        continue            # Skip the iteration once we meet the criteria in ``if`` statement
    print(count)
```

#### Output
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

### 2.3 `else`

The `else` clause is executed after the loop completes its execution without hitting a `break` statement.

### When to use:

- To check if a loop has completed normally without any `break`.
- To perform certain final actions after loop completion.

#### Example 

**_Objective_**: We want to assure that loop has completed without exiting.

```python
# Example of else with a for loop
for number in range(3):
    print(number)
    if number > 2:
      print('123213')
      break
else:
    print("No Break")
```

```
0
1
2
No Break
```
With control statements, you can create loops that handle a wide range of dynamic conditions and scenarios. Try it yourself!

### 2.4 Assigments

#### Assigment 1: The Menu Navigator

**_Objective_**: Write a program that simulates a menu navigation system using a while loop and break statement.
The user can select from a list of options, and the loop terminates when the user selects the `'Exit'` option.

```
Input:
1. Start Game
2. Load Game
3. Exit
Choose an option: 3

Output:
Exiting the menu...
```

#### Assigment 2: The Odd Number Skipper

**_Objective_**: Create a program that prints out all numbers from 1 to 20, but skips odd numbers using one of control statements.

```
Output:
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20
```

#### Assigment 3: The Prime Number Identifier

**_Objective_**: Develop a script that identifies whether a number is prime. Use a `for`  `else` construction. If the loop completes without breaking, the number is prime.

```
Input: Enter a number: 11

Output: 11 is a prime number.
```

#### Assigment 4: The Escape Room

**_Objective_**: Simulate an escape room challenge where the user must find the correct code to "escape the room." The loop should break once the correct code is entered.

```
Input:
Enter the escape code: 1234
Wrong code, try again.
Enter the escape code: 9999
Correct! You've escaped!

Output:
You've successfully escaped the room!
```

#### Assigment 5: The Input Validator

**_Objective_**: Write a program that asks users to enter their age and ensures the input is valid using a while loop. If the input is not a number, use continue to prompt them again until a valid number is entered.


```
Input:
Enter your age: twenty
Invalid input, please enter a number.
Enter your age: 20

Output:
Age entered: 20
```


## 3. Nested Loops

Nested loops in `Python` are when you have **_a loop running inside another loop_**.

Sounds scary, right? I remember myself, when I started learning programming, the concept of nested loops was one of the harderst to undersatand. 

I wanted to quit programming studying this section. But now, I will try to explain everything to you to make nested loops clear! Don't be afraid of _nested loops_!

#### Example 

The great example can be a `clock` where: 

1. The hour hand _completes one full rotation_ while the minute _hand completes 12 full_.
2. The minute hand _completes one full rotation (outer loop)_, while the second hand completes 60 full rotations (inner loop).

***NOTE***: The `inner loop` completes its execution for every iteration of the `outer loop`.

```python
# Outer loop for the hour hand
for hour in range(12):
    # Inner loop for the minute hand
    for minute in range(60):
        # Another inner loop for the second hand
        for second in range(60):
            print(f"{hour} hours {minute} minutes {second} seconds")
```

#### Output
```
# Firstly the ``second's`` loop is going to be executed

0 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds
0 hours 0 minutes 1 seconds
0 hours 0 minutes 2 seconds
0 hours 0 minutes 3 seconds
0 hours 0 minutes 4 seconds

# Secondly, ``minutes'`` inner loop and lastly, the ``hours``
```

#### Example 

Imagine fans in a stadium chanting. For each round `(outer loop)` they clap several times `(inner loop)`.

```python
# Outer loop for each chanting round
for round in range(3):
    print("Let's go, team!")
    # Inner loop for clapping
    for clap in range(3):
        print("Clap!", end=' ')
    print()  # New line after the claps
```

#### Output

```
Let's go, team!
Clap! Clap! Clap! 
Let's go, team!
Clap! Clap! Clap! 
Let's go, team!
Clap! Clap! Clap! 
```

#### Example

Let's create a multiplication table for numbers 1 to 3, up to the times 10. 

The `outer loop` can iterate over the numbers you want to `multiply`, and _`the inner loop`_ can iterate _`over the range of multipliers`_.

```python
# For numbers 1, 2, 3
for i in range(1, 4):  
    # From 1 times to 10 times
    for j in range(1, 11): 
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {i*j}")
    print()  # New line
```

#### Output

```
# 1st work of the outer loop
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
...
1 x 10 = 10

# 2nd work of the outer loop
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
...
2 x 10 = 20

# 3rd work of the outer loop
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
...
3 x 9 = 27
```

You can use [`Python Visualizer`](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) in order to understand the concept of `nested loops` better.


There are lots of practical cases where software engenieer can use nested loops. You will notice that we sometimes will be coming back to them working with advanced data structures.
