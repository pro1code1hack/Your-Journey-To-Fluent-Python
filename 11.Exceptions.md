## 1 Introduction

Error handling is an important component of programming that provides opportunity for code to adequately respond to unexpected situations. In Python, errors are managed through the use of exceptions, which are special objects that represent error conditions.

When Python interpreter stumbles upon a situation it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. If the exception isn't handled, the program will terminate abruptly, which can lead to a poor user experience or even loss of data.

## 2 The `try` & `except` Block

In Python, error handling is managed with the use of `try` and `except` keywords.

### 2.1 How do `try` and `except` work?

The `try` keyword indicates a beginning of a block. Python will first try to run the code inside the block and if an error occurs, it will look for the instructions in `except` block. The error can be specified and the code inside the block will be executed only in case exception was caught.

#### Example

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

#### Output

```
Cannot divide by zero!
```

#### Explanation

The code inside the `try` block raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. The `except` block catches this exception and prints a message, without crashing the programm.

### 2.2 `except Exception as e`

For debugging purposes, or sometimes even in production, when you aren't sure about the possible errors or you simply 
want to ignore them you can use `except Exception as e` construction.

#### Example

```python
try:
    print(3 / 0) # this will raise ZeroDivisionError 
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

#### Output

```
An error occurred: division by zero
```

You could also use bare `except` block solely for debugging purposes, however it is highly advised against it and simply 
forbidden in development. It is not a good idea to use this construction because it may lead to bad overall performance 
of the program.

#### Example

```python
responses = []

for i in range(0, 9999):
    try:
        response = requests.get("http://example.com")
        responses.append(response)
    except:
        pass

print(len(responses))
```

#### Output

```
6785
```

#### Explanation

The provided code is using `requsts` module, you will learn more about it in the next lesson, for now, all you need to 
know is that it can be used to retrieve information from the website, in the process called parsing. 

You would expect this program to print 9999 as we have tried to access "http://example.com" 9999 and should have gotten
same amount of responses, however in reality, during the parsing process many things can go wrong, for example:
 - Bad internet connection might raise a requests error, passing straight to `except`
 - The website access can be limited, meaning that you can only open it 10 times in a minute, and considering that we are trying to parse it, we open it more than 1000 times oer minute.
 - If the domain you are accessing is changing, it can simply not exist, raising an error once again.

So all of these are possible problems that might have occurred during the execution and because you used bare `except', 
you won't be able to identify what specifically went wrong and how to improve the quality of parsing.

### 2.3 Catching Multiple Exceptions

You can catch multiple exceptions by specifying multiple `except` blocks. Each `except` block can handle a different type of exception in a **different** way.

```python
try:
    # Some code that might raise different types of exceptions
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Handle division by zero
except ValueError:
    # Handle value errors
except Exception as e:
    # Handle any other exceptions
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### 2.4 Multiple Exception Types

You can also catch multiple exception types in a single `except` block by providing a tuple of exception types.

```python
try:
    # Some code that might raise different types of exceptions
except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) as e:
    # Handle both ZeroDivisionError and ValueError
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## 3 The `else` Block

In Python, the `else` block can be used in conjunction with the `try` and `except` blocks to define a block of code that should only be executed if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block. The `else` block is an optional part of the error-handling mechanism and provides a clear way to separate the normal execution path from the error-handling code.

#### Example

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
else:
    print(f"The result is {result}")
```

#### Output

```
The result is 5
```

#### Explanation

In this example, the code inside the `try` block successfully completes without raising any exceptions, so the `else` block is executed, and the result is printed.

### 3.1 When to use `else`

The `else` block is useful when you want to separate the code that might raise an exception from the code that should 
only be executed if no exceptions occur. This separation can improve the readability of your code and make it easier to understand the flow of execution.

Though, I must admit that the following approach (??? huh what approach) is not really popular among Python society. Have no idea why, to be honest...

### 3.2 Note

- The `else` block must follow all `except` blocks and will only be executed if the `try` block does not raise an exception.
- If an exception is raised in the `else` block, it will not be caught by the preceding `except` blocks.

## 4 The `finally` Block

In Python, the `finally` block is an important part of exception handling that is used in combination with `try` and 
`except` blocks. The `finally` block contains code that is guaranteed to execute, regardless of whether an exception is 
raised in the `try` block or not.

#### Example:

```python
try:
    print(10 / int(input("input your number:")))
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("0 is not accepted")
finally:
    print("Thank you for using this program.")
```

#### Explanation
In this example, 10 is attempted to be divided by user input  in the `try` block. If user inputs 0, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised and caught in the `except` block. Regardless of whether the mathematical operation was successfully or not, the `finally` block prints the closing message.

## 5 Raising Exceptions

While Python and its libraries raise exceptions automatically under certain conditions, you also have the ability to manually
raise exceptions in your code. 

This is particularly useful for enforcing constraints, validating input, or signaling 
that a specific error condition has occurred.

### 5.1 Understanding `raise`

The `raise` statement allows you to throw an exception at any point in your program. When an exception is raised, it 
interrupts the normal flow of the program and transfers control to the nearest enclosing `try` block.

### 5.2 Syntax of `raise`

The basic syntax to raise an exception is:

```python
raise ExceptionType("Description of the error.")
```

Where `ExceptionType` is the class of the exception you want to raise (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `KeyError`), and the string provides a description of the error.

### 5.3 Use Cases

1. **Input Validation**: If a function requires inputs to meet certain conditions, you can raise an exception if the provided inputs are invalid.

   ```python
   def set_age(age):
       if age < 0:
           raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative")
   try:
       set_age(-5)
   except ValueError as e:
       print(e)
   ```

2. **Enforcing Constraints**: When certain states or conditions must not occur within a program, raising exceptions can enforce these constraints explicitly.

   ```python
   inventory = {'apple': 10, 'banana': 5}
   def add_to_cart(item, quantity, cart):
       if item not in inventory:
           raise KeyError("Item not available")
       if inventory[item] < quantity:
           raise ValueError("Insufficient stock")
       cart[item] = quantity
       inventory[item] -= quantity
   ```

3. **Signaling Unimplemented Features**: If a part of your code is not yet implemented, you can raise a `NotImplementedError` as a placeholder.
   ```python
   def future_feature():
       raise NotImplementedError("This feature is coming soon!")
   try:
       future_feature()
   except NotImplementedError as e:
       print(e)
   ```

There are no limits for your imagination in terms of handling errors, again this will come with practice, just think about potential errors which might occur inside the application and try to handle them gracefully!

### 5.5 Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Prefer raising and catching specific exceptions rather than the general `Exception` class. This makes error handling more predictable, robust, and optimised.

- **Provide Useful Messages**: When raising exceptions, include a clear, descriptive message to make it easier to understand the cause of the error.

- **Use Exceptions Judiciously**: While exceptions are powerful, using them inappropriately can make your code harder to understand and maintain. Avoid using exceptions for normal flow control, and prefer using them for actual error conditions.


## 6 Exception Chaining

Exception chaining in Python is a mechanism that allows you to link exceptions together, making it easier to understand
a sequence of errors that led to a failure.

This feature is particularly useful when an exception is raised while handling another exception.

### 6.1 Implicit Exception Chaining

Python automatically chains exceptions if an exception is raised inside an `except` block. The original exception is 
available in the `__context__` attribute of the new exception.

#### Example

```python
try:
    # This block intentionally raises a ZeroDivisionError
    result = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    try:
        # This block will raise a NameError
        print(unknown_variable)
    except NameError as e:
        raise RuntimeError("A NameError occurred") from e
```

#### Explanation

In this example, the `NameError` is implicitly chained to the `RuntimeError`. Python will display both exceptions, 
indicating that the `RuntimeError` was directly raised while handling the `NameError`.

### 6.2 Explicit Exception Chaining with `from`

You can explicitly chain exceptions using the `from` keyword. This allows you to specify the cause of the exception, 
which can be either another exception instance or `None` to indicate that the chaining should be suppressed.

#### Example

```python
try:
    # Some operation that fails
    open("nonexistent_file.txt")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    # Explicitly chaining the exception
    raise ValueError("Failed to open configuration.") from e
```

#### Example
In this case, if the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised, and it is explicitly chained to a 
`ValueError`. When the exception is caught, Python will indicate that the `ValueError` was directly raised from the
`FileNotFoundError`.

### 6.3 Suppressing Exception Chaining

You can suppress exception chaining by specifying `from None`. This is useful when the exception context is not helpful
or you want to prevent the display of chained exceptions.

#### Example of Suppressing Exception Chaining:

```python
try:
    some_operation()
except SomeError as e:
    raise DifferentError("An error occurred") from None
```

This prevents Python from chaining the exceptions, so only the `DifferentError` is shown to the user, making the error 
message cleaner.

## 8. Homework

### Task 1: Safe Division

**Objective**: Create a function `safe_divide` that safely performs division and handles any division errors gracefully.

#### Requirements:

- The function should accept two parameters, `numerator` and `denominator`.
- Use `try` and `except` blocks to handle division errors such as `ZeroDivisionError`.
- If a division by zero occurs, print an error message and return `None`.
- If the division is successful, return the result.
- Use the `finally` block to print a message that the division attempt has been completed.

```python
print(safe_divide(10, 2))  # Output: 5.0
print(safe_divide(5, 0))   # Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero
```

### Task 2: Voting

**Objective**: Implement a function `check_voter_age` that checks if a person is eligible to vote and raises an exception if the age is below the minimum voting age.

#### Requirements:

- The function should accept one integer argument, `age`.
- If `age` is less than 18, raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the person is too young to vote.
- If `age` is 18 or above, print a message confirming that the person is allowed to vote.
- Use a `try` block to test the function with different ages and an `except` block to catch and print the ValueError message.

```python
check_voter_age(21)  # Output: You are allowed to vote.
check_voter_age(16)  # Output: Error: You are too young to vote.
```
